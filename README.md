# Kmart

x86 blockchain, leveraging QEMU's deterministic execution capabilities. Write your smart contract in any language you want: as long as you can package it as a disk image for an x86\_64 machine (or a multiboot ELF), Kmart can run it.

Acts as an Execution Layer client for an Ethereum PoS Consensus Layer client, currently Lodestar.

Work in progress.
